#Define an integer variable n. Now create a list containing the first n powers of 2,
#starting with 2^1. For example, for n = 4, the list should contain the values
#[2, 4, 8, 16].

#n = 4
#powers_of_two = [2 ** i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
# print(powers_of_two)

#Test your code with n = 1, n = 4, and n = 10.
